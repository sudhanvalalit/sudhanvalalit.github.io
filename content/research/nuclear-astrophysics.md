## Research Highlights

### The Dense Matter Equation of State Is Important... Just Not for This Reason

![Neutron star crust cooling plot](../img/NuclearAstro/TvsP2log.jpg)

The dense matter equation of state is required to describe matter at ultrahigh densities. Its elucidation is one of the primary goals of nuclear astrophysics. Neutron stars cooling off after siphoning gas from a binary companion for months or longer, so-called cooling transients, are one available probe to constrain the dense matter equation of state.

In this work, we show that the crust-core transition pressure does not significantly alter model calculation results for cooling transients, thereby simplifying the associated model-observation comparisons. This work was done in collaboration with Dr. Zach Meisel of the Ohio University and Dr. Edward Brown of the Michigan State University.
