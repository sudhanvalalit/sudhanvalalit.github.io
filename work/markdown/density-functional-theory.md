# Density Functional Theory

![Nuclear DFT](../img/NuclearAstro/TvsP2log.jpg)

Density functional theory (DFT) is a powerful quantum mechanical modeling method used to investigate the electronic and nuclear structure of many-body systems. My research applies DFT to understand nuclear properties, pairing correlations, and collective phenomena in atomic nuclei.
