# What is a neutron star composed of?

![Neutron star composition diagram](../img/NuclearAstro/neutron_star_composition.jpg) This section will delve into the theoretical models and experimental data used to understand the composition of neutron stars. This includes:

- Different proposed phases of dense matter (e.g., quark matter, hyperons).
- How observations (like gravitational waves from binary neutron star mergers) help constrain these compositions.
