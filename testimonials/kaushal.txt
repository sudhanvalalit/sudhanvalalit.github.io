I was very fortunate to have met him during my first year of bachelors. He was the General secretary of Physical society at the University. His teaching is immaculate. He has in depth knowledge of innumerable topics in mathematical, physical, statistical and many other sciences. This extends to non sciences as well.

He knows many languages, including a lot of sanskrit, which I think is very rare. He makes sure he completes what he starts and I am saying this by seeing him start learning guitar and gradually in months to come, playing songs on guitar. Self taught. He always helps people who need his help.

I have known him for 8 years. He will definitely add a lot of value to any company or an institution that he will be part of. He leads by an example. Helping people meet their goals in time.
