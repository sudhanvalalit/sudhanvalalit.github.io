Sudhanva is one of the smartest person I have ever meet in my life. He is a mathematics expert with great communication skills to explain complex and abstract topics in simple manner. He is a hard working person and always have great interest to learn quickly and implement in real life situations to solve problems. I strongly recommend him for any job he applies as he is a kind of person who can work in any team and easily merge with team.
