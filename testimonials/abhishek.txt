I know Sudhanva Lalit for over 7 years. He is hard working. He is knowledgeable in the field of
                    theoretical physics and mathematics. I have learned Topology, Homology, Group theory, Differential
                    Geometry from Sudhanva. In addition to that on the Physics side I have learned Field theory and
                    General theory of relativity from him. He is amazing teacher. He always tries to employ best
                    practices
                    for the teaching. He believes in constructive criticism and that motivates people. I have worked
                    under
                    him in Physical Society, a graduate student organization. He is a team player. It was pleasing
                    working
                    under him. For research he is well organized and very innovative. He can come up with novel ideas
                    and
                    can work on them. His strong suits are positive attitude, hard working and well organized.
